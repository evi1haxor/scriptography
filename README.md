Well, that's what I call it. Couldn't come up with a better name. Anyways, this script works with selenium and chrome webdriver. So for running it, you should have python3 and selenium installed and latest version of Chrome webdriver downloaded. 

**Note that you got to change path to** `chromedrive.exe`  and **modify** `targets.py` **accordingly before executing the script.**
