This repo contains scripts written by me for my personal convenient usage. If problems are relatable, you too can use them right away.

# push

>  [UNSTABLE AT THE MOMENT]

this `push` script will do all boring runs for you so that you can focus on constructive works instead. 

## Setting up
All you need to do is just put it in your local git repositories and run following command on the terminal-
```
chmod u+x push.py
```
Now you should be good to go.

> `push` can work with or without parsed argument. It can generate the commit message by itself if not parsed manually. So all you are supposed to do is running the script by `./push.py` or pass the arguments.

Doing `./push.py -h` might not give you complete information about the required arguments due to conditional addition of arguments. So attached _help_ page herein.
```
positional arguments:
  stg             specs for stage
  commit_message  CommitMessage <message should be in triple dual-quotes.>

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
```
